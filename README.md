# Getting Started with MOBLIMA
SSP3 Group 3

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `MainView.java` (Moblima-Project/src/MainView.java)

Run MainView to start our program. This will prompt the starting point of our system, the MainMenu.
From here, you can navigate freely to any other pages.

## About Movie Booking and LIsting Management Application (MOBLIMA)

MOBLIMA is an application to computerize the processes of making online bookings and purchasing movie tickets, listing movies and sale reporting. It will be used by the moviegoers and cinema staff. The application acts as a centralized ‘location’ for booking all the Cineplexes in different locations managed by the vendor.

### Demonstration Video
We have provided a 15-minute Video Report of our Demonstration. This video contains an explanation of our MOBLIMA, along with the different resulting outputs and flows for different test cases. __The video link is attached inside our Report.__

### Report
The design considerations, principles and use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts can be found in the full report 'SSP3-grp3.pdf'. The report also includes a detailed UML Class Diagram for the MOBLIMA, followed by screenshots of some test runs of our program that are not included in our Demonstration Video.
