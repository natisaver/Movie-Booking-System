## About MOvie Booking and LIsting Management Application (MOBLIMA)

MOBLIMA is an application to computerize the processes of making online booking and purchase of movie tickets, listing of movies and sale reporting. It will be used by the moviegoers and cinema staff. The application acts as a centralized ‘location’ for making bookings for all the Cineplex’s in different locations managed by the vendor.

### Implementation Video
We have provided a 15 minute Video Report of our Implementation. This video contains explanation of our MOBLIMA, along with the different resulting outputs and flows for different test cases.

### Report
The design considerations, principles and use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts can be found in the full report 'SC2002 Moblima Report.pdf'. The report also includes a detailed UML Class Diagram for the MOBLIMA, followed by screenshots of some test runs of our program that are not included in our Implementation Video.
